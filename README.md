# Biogeography Repository
## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the study and analysis of biogeography, the branch of science that examines the distribution of species and ecosystems in geographic space and through geological time. It contains datasets, R scripts, and models related to various aspects of biogeography, including but not limited to species distribution models, biodiversity patterns, and ecological niche modeling.

## Installation
To use the scripts and datasets in this repository, you will need to have R installed on your machine. You can download R from CRAN. Additionally, some scripts may require specific R packages, which are listed in the requirements section below.

## Requirements
R (Version 4.3.3 or later)
RStudio (Recommended for ease of use)
Required R packages:
  'sp' for spatial analysis
  'raster' for handling raster data
  'dismo' for species distribution modeling
Please refer to the install_packages.R script for a complete list of required packages and installation instructions.

Example Scripts
species_distribution_model.R: This script demonstrates how to build a species distribution model using occurrence data and environmental variables.
biodiversity_analysis.R: Analyzes patterns of biodiversity across different geographic regions.
Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community, whether it's adding new scripts, improving existing ones, or providing datasets.
